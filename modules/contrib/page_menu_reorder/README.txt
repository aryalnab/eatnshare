INTRODUCTION
------------

Page menu reorder module helps to rearrange menu links of a page. 
A new reorder tab isadded onto a page if the page has menu links. 
It works similar to Drupal 7 version of submenu reorder module
(https://www.drupal.org/project/submenu_reorder) but this module 
is developed in Drupal 8.

Normally we reorder the menu links on the 
menu administration page admin/structure/menu/manage/main. 
But it’s not so easier for a large site with hundreds of menu links. 
Also we need to restrict access to the global menu admin page. 
This module helps to overcome the issues.

This module works with the menu `Main navigation` for now. 
This could be easily extended to work with other menus.

Thanks to the University of Surrey for supporting us in developing the module.
